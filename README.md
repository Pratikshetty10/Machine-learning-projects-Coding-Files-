Heart disease prediction coding files
Summary
In model used 4 alogrithms i.e LogisticRegression,Decision tree,RandomForest Gradient boosting.
Accurcay of decision tree & random forest is 0.99 that means it is overfitting.So, we will not consider that
Comparsion of accuracy of logistic regression & Gradient boosting.The gradient boosting is giving  beter accuracy i.e 0.93.
Conclusion:Gradient Boosting is better for the heart disease prediction models.
